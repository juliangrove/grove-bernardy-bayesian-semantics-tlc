** Case 1
- prior for θ uniform [0,1000]
- prior height distribution normal(68,34)
- possible utterances (vlad tall, vlad not tall)

- l0 distributions vlad's height not noticably different from prior
- l0 posterior for θ is "s curves" (this is because the listener expects the
  individual to be about average, so if the utterance is true, the
  prior must be either below (respectively above) average).

- l1 posterior for vlad's height has nearly the same average, but a
  smaller variance than the prior. This is because the posterior is
  still very much unknown--- but precisely in a way that makes it
  likely.

- l0 posterior for θ is "s curve", but this time with sharper fall off.
  
** Case 2
- prior for θ distribution normal(68,34)
- prior height distribution normal(68,34)
- possible utterances (vlad tall, vlad not tall)
